			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Jamie Jasmine Koh. I am 19 years old as of 2021. I was born and raised in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.</p>
			
			<p>Kota Kinabalu is a lovely town near many beaches such as Tanjung Aru, Tanjung Lipat and the beaches at Sutera Harbour. There are also many interesting things to do like visiting one of the many beaches, hiking in scenic locations, horse riding, snorkeling, shopping, and enjoying the local cuisine.</p>
			
			<p>I enjoy visiting beaches or waterfront. Usually, I would jump rope for about 30 minutes while my mother jogs for an hour. So, while waiting for her to finish, I get to roam around the beach.I also like baking, painting, drawing, watching movies and reading.

		<caption>My Contributions to Tome Times</caption>
		<tr>
			<th>Tome Times Logo</th>
			<td>I designed a simple logo for this website using Adobe Illustrator. I decided to use the letter "T" as the main subject so that it is easy to remember the logo's representation of Tome Times.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Tome Times Pictures</th>
			<td>All the pictures of Tome Times except the picture of me are abstract illustrations downloaded from Freepik. I then recoloured all and edited some of the pictures in Adobe Illustrator so that they were customized for the website. This is why all the images roughly follow the same colour scheme throughout the whole website.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Tome Times Content</th>
			<td>All the content of the Tome Times web pages were written and styled by myself. The rates were decided based on the rates of other websites such as Audible and Wall Street Journal.</td>
