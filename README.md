# Tome_Times
This website was built using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, icons and some images were originally dowloaded in vector form from icons8 and freepik and then modified by myself in Adobe Illustrate
As this was a university project, some features were made specifically to meet the unit's grading criteria. Such features include:
- The disclaimer page
- The profile page
- The enhancement pages and everything listed on those pages
Important note:
- The staff and and enquiry pages do not work as they should because I no longer have access to the database related to them
- I use localhost to open the website in Chrome because that was the way I was taught and I am not sure of alternative ways
- This website was built in 2021 and since then, my studies have focused on other aspects of Computer Science. As such, I currently do not posess the level of proficiency in this kind of web design demonstrated in this website but this showcase is my way of proving that I am capable of relearning and reaching at least to this skill level if it is required of me
